## List of Experiments

1. **Network Commands Exploration**
   - Learn to use commands like `tcpdump`, `netstat`, `ifconfig`, `nslookup`, and `traceroute`.
   - Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine.

2. **HTTP Web Client Program**
   - Write an HTTP web client program to download a web page using TCP sockets.

3. **Applications using TCP Sockets**
   - üîÑ Echo client and echo server.
   - üí¨ Chat application.
   - üìÅ File Transfer application.

4. **Simulation of DNS using UDP Sockets**
   - Implement and simulate the Domain Name System (DNS) using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) sockets.

5. **ARP / RARP Protocols Simulation**
   - Write a code simulating Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP).

6. **Network Simulator (NS) Study**
   - Study the Network Simulator (NS) and simulate Congestion Control Algorithms using NS.

7. **TCP/UDP Performance Study**
   - Study the performance of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using simulation tools.

8. **Distance Vector/Link State Routing Simulation**
   - Simulate Distance Vector and Link State Routing algorithms.

9. **Routing Protocols Performance Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of routing protocols using simulation tools.

10. **Error Correction Code Simulation**
    - Simulate error correction codes like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).
